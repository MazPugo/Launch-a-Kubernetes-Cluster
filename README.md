Here, you’ll go from zero experience to running your very own Kubernetes cluster — and along the way, discover why engineers everywhere love it for deploying and scaling applications.

In this project, you’ll:

- Launch and connect to an EC2 instance — your base for running Kubernetes.

- Spin up your very first Kubernetes cluster — see how clusters come to life in the cloud.

- Monitor cluster creation with CloudFormation — watch infrastructure automation in action.

- Securely access your cluster with an IAM access entry — the right way to connect and manage.

- (Secret Mission) Test your cluster’s resilience — break it on purpose and watch Kubernetes heal itself!
